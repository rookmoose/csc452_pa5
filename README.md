# csc452_pa5

The scripts ./get and ./push are wrappers around scp'ing files to and from
lectura. For each script, modify two things:
-- replace netid with your own netid
-- ~/Desktop/452_pa6 should be the directory where you're storing the copies of your files

NOTE: make sure you modify the netid and directory in BOTH files
